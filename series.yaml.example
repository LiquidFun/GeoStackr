### Example:
series:
    - title: October Streak Stacker
      author: olsnes
      regex: \d{1,3}00 # will match 100, 200 ... 9800, 9900
    - title: November Streak Stacker
      author: olsnes
      regex: \d{1,5} # will match # 1, 2 ... 99998, 99999
      max: 25000 # will then limit the score to 25000 (what the regex can't do)
      min: 0
      goal: highest # will maximize the score, so that it matches the regex, but stays within min/max
